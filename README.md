# Python Questions.

## Questions 1.
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for the multiples of 3 prints “Vee” instead of the number, for the multiples of 5 prints “pee” and for the multiples of 3 and 5 print “Veepee”.
## Question 2.
Given a list of strings, write a program that determines the minimum number of letters you need to specify in order unequivocally identify a string. Also, give the complexity of the proposed solution. 
Example: Given this list of strings:
- aacaa 
- aacba 
- aacca 

You need to give at least 4 letters to unequivocally identify each string, because you can identify the ﬁrst one knowing that it starts with aaca, with the second one you just need aacb and with the third one aacc. 
Another example:
- privalia 
- veepee 
- venteprivee 

In this case you need to specify at least 3 letters. With the ﬁrst one you only need one character (p) to completely identify the string, but with the second and the third ones you need at least 3 characters (vee and ven).
